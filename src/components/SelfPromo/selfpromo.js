        Hi, my name is
        <h1>Benjamin Smolin</h1>

      <p>
        I received a B.S. in Computer Science from Temple University in December, 2022. I'm interested in full-stack software development, FOSS,
        machine learning, and information visualizations. Outside of the world of computers, I like cycling, fishkeeping, and movies. I built this
        website to show off some of the bigger projects I'm proud of working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently looking for work in the software engineering world! If you'd like to connect professionally or are interested in collaborating
        on a project check out these links:
